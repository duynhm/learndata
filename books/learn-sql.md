Welcome to our PostgreSQL interactive SQL Tutorial! We’ve designed this specifically for tech-savvy folks to learn enough SQL to be able to do their own analysis and data fetching.

We’ve added a big innovation to our tutorial that makes it quite different: Because we believe the best way to learn SQL is by playing around, we’ve created an interactive **SQLBox** for you to follow along and play with writing queries from the very start.The SQLBox takes your input and runs it against a live PostgreSQL database that we’re hosting.
