I first learned about data analytic about 5 years ago and I have been hooked ever since. While completing numerous data related courses I saw the applications of data science to drive human behavior. As a consultant to an educational platform, such as Udacity, I have been utilizing my specialized knowledge in the fields of programming, data and predictive analytics for the last 4 years.
