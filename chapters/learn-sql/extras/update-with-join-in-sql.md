Data School wants a comprehensive post showing the different ways this is possible. Please use stack overflow to understand the many variations: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1293330/how-can-i-do-an-update-statement-with-join-in-sql](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1293330/how-can-i-do-an-update-statement-with-join-in-sql "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1293330/how-can-i-do-an-update-statement-with-join-in-sql")

The structure of the post should be

* **Answer the question simply** (provide sql query when appropriate)
* **Define example scenario** we will be using (use a familiar dataset: facebook friends, Amazon store, Uber riders, etc)
  * Provide a small table
* **Use images to show** what is happening
  * link to other Data School pages/images where appropriate (joins, aggregations, subqueries, window functions, case when)
* **Demonstrate** in detail with SQL
* **Recap** why this was important to answer the question
