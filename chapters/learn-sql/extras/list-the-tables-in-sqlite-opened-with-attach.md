Data School wants a comprehensive post showing the different ways to list the tables in a SQLite database file that was opened with ATTACH. Please use stack overflow to understand the many variations: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/82875/how-to-list-the-tables-in-a-sqlite-database-file-that-was-opened-with-attach](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/82875/how-to-list-the-tables-in-a-sqlite-database-file-that-was-opened-with-attach "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/82875/how-to-list-the-tables-in-a-sqlite-database-file-that-was-opened-with-attach")

The structure of the post should be

* **Answer the question simply** (provide sql query when appropriate)
* **Define example scenario** we will be using (use a familiar dataset: facebook friends, Amazon store, Uber riders, etc)
  * Provide a small table
* **Use images to show** what is happening
  * link to other Data School pages/images where appropriate (joins, aggregations, subqueries, window functions, case when)
* **Demonstrate** in detail with SQL
* **Recap** why this was important to answer the question.
