Data School wants a comprehensive post with visuals to help people understand storing hierarchical data. Please use stack overflow to understand the various methods: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4048151/what-are-the-options-for-storing-hierarchical-data-in-a-relational-database](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4048151/what-are-the-options-for-storing-hierarchical-data-in-a-relational-database "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4048151/what-are-the-options-for-storing-hierarchical-data-in-a-relational-database")

The structure of the post should be

* **Answer the question simply** (provide sql query when appropriate)
* **Define example scenario** we will be using (use a familiar dataset: facebook friends, Amazon store, Uber riders, etc)
  * Provide a small table
* **Use images to show** what is happening
  * link to other Data School pages/images where appropriate (joins, aggregations, subqueries, window functions, case when)
* **Demonstrate** in detail with SQL
* **Recap** why this was important to answer the question
